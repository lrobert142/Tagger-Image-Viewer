# Tagger-Image-Viewer

A React front-end to manage and view images by tags

## Key Tasks / Scripts

  * To start the React front end, in Terminal run `npm start`
  * To compile SASS files into CSS files **only once**, run `npm build-css`
  * To compile SASS files into CSS files and **recompile every time a change is detected**, run `npm run watch-css`
    * Note: In both of the above cases, a CSS file containing all compiled styles will be generated at `src/main.css`
