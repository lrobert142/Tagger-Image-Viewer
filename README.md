# Tagger-Image-Viewer

A React front-end to manage and view images by tags

## Key Tasks / Scripts

  * To start the application in browser, in Terminal run `meteor` at the root of the project
  * To compile SASS files into CSS files **only once**, run `npm build-css`
  * To compile SASS files into CSS files and **recompile every time a change is detected**, run `npm run watch-css`
    * Note: In both of the above cases, a CSS file containing all compiled styles will be generated at `src/main.css`

## Assistant Script

Included in the `util` directory is a bash script that can help automate more mundane tasks. The specific assistance the script can provide is described below.
  * Alternatively you can view script usage by calling the script with the `usage` argument

### Create a new component

Calling `helper.sh` with the `new_component` or `new` argument will bootstrap all default files that should be created when a new component is created. This bootstrapping includes:
  * Creating the JS component itself located under the `imports/ui/` directory
    * Note: The component will have the first letter of it's name capitalized. Remaining letters will be unaffected.
  * Creating the JS component test located under the `imports/ui/test/` directory
    * Note: The component will have the first letter of it's name capitalized. Remaining letters will be unaffected.
  * Creating the SASS stylesheet located under the `client/sass/components/` directory
    * Note: The component will have the first letter of it's name lowercased and an underscore prepended. Remaining letters will be unaffected.
  * Including the new SASS file to the `client/sass/components/all.scss` file via `@include "<stylesheet>";`

> Note: Data is **appended** to the end of files via this helper. This is to avoid overwriting existing files' content if a file with the request name already exists.
